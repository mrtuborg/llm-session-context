# LLM Context System Generator

**PRIMARY GOAL:** Generate optimized LLM context management systems for new projects  
**EVOLUTION METHOD:** Research-driven development through systematic knowledge accumulation

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Generate Context System for Your Project

### **Step 1: Deploy Context System to Your Project**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run the deployment script
python /path/to/LLM_Context_System/deploy.py --project-type [technical|research|documentation] --target-dir ./LM_context
```

### **Step 2: Customize for Your Project**
1. **Edit `LM_context/static/environment.md`** - Add your project-specific environment details
2. **Update `LM_context/evolving/project-plan.md`** - Define your project structure and goals
3. **Configure `LM_context/dynamic/current-iteration.md`** - Set your initial work context

### **Step 3: Start Using Your Context System**
1. **Begin each LLM session** by loading the context files in this order:
   - `dynamic/current-iteration.md` (always)
   - `dynamic/session-handoff.md` (if continuing previous work)
   - `evolving/` files (as needed for context)
   - `static/` files (rarely, but when needed)

2. **End each session** by updating:
   - `dynamic/session-handoff.md` - Preserve context for next session
   - `dynamic/working-solutions.md` - Add any solutions discovered
   - `dynamic/current-iteration.md` - Update progress and next steps

3. **Accumulate knowledge** by documenting:
   - **Solutions that work** → `dynamic/working-solutions.md`
   - **Approaches that failed** → `dynamic/failed-solutions/[domain]-failures.md`
   - **Assumptions being tested** → `evolving/assumptions-log.md`

### **Step 4: Optimize Your System**
Run the validation script periodically to assess and improve your context system:
```bash
cd your-project/LM_context
python dynamic/assumption-validator.py
```

2. **Improve deployment logic** in `deploy.py` with new optimization strategies
3. **Add validation capabilities** to automatically assess system effectiveness
4. **Test enhancements** by deploying to new projects and measuring results

#### **Step 4: Validate and Iterate**
1. **Measure improvements** using established metrics (token usage, continuity accuracy, reuse rates)
2. **Document findings** in the knowledge base
3. **Share insights** with the community
4. **Continue the evolution cycle**
