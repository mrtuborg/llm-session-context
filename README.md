# LLM Context System Generator

**PRIMARY GOAL:** Generate optimized LLM context management systems for new projects  
**EVOLUTION METHOD:** Research-driven development through systematic knowledge accumulation

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Generate Context System for Your Project

### **Step 1: Deploy Context System to Your Project**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run the deployment script
python /path/to/LLM_Context_System/deploy.py --target-dir ./LM_context
```

### **Step 2: Start Working with Your LLM**
Simply copy-paste this command to your LLM to begin:

```
Start session: Read context (session-handoff, current-iteration, environment, failed-solutions), ask 3-5 specific questions based on what you find, then summarize status and next actions.
```

**The LLM will automatically:**
- Read and analyze your project context
- Ask targeted questions to understand your current needs
- Customize the system based on your project
- Load the right files in the optimal order
- Update all context files as you work

### **Step 3: End Each Session**
Copy-paste this command when finishing:

```
End session: Compile knowledge (update working-solutions.md, failed-solutions/, create daily log in archive/daily-logs/), update session-handoff.md and current-iteration.md, update knowledge base in static/knowledge-base/, ask closure questions about knowledge completeness and next priorities.
```

**The LLM will automatically:**
- Save all solutions and failures discovered
- Update session handoff for perfect continuity
- Preserve all knowledge for future reuse
- Prepare the next session context

### **Step 4: Optimize Your System**
Run the validation script periodically to assess and improve your context system:
```bash
cd your-project/LM_context
python dynamic/assumption-validator.py
```

## 🎯 Agile Planning & Schedule Adaptation

### **Built-in Agile Framework**
The system includes **comprehensive agile planning capabilities** that automatically adapt to schedule changes:

#### **Iteration-Based Development**
- **Current Iteration Tracking:** `dynamic/current-iteration.md` maintains active sprint context
- **Hypothesis-Driven Development:** Each iteration tests specific hypotheses with measurable success criteria
- **Adaptive Planning:** LLM automatically adjusts plans based on progress and blockers
- **Schedule Flexibility:** System adapts to timeline changes while preserving progress

#### **Automatic Schedule Updates**
When you copy-paste the session commands, the LLM will:
- **Assess current progress** against iteration goals and timeline
- **Identify schedule risks** and suggest mitigation strategies
- **Rebalance priorities** based on available time and resources
- **Update iteration plans** to fit within schedule constraints
- **Preserve critical path** while adjusting non-essential features

#### **Agile Planning Features**
```
✅ Sprint Planning: Define iteration goals with success criteria
✅ Daily Standups: Session-based progress tracking and blocker identification
✅ Sprint Reviews: Automatic progress assessment and iteration closure
✅ Retrospectives: Lessons learned capture and process improvement
✅ Backlog Management: Priority-based feature and task management
✅ Schedule Adaptation: Automatic plan adjustment for timeline changes
```

#### **Schedule Adaptation Commands**
For schedule changes, use these additional commands:

**Schedule Pressure (Deadline Moved Up):**
```
Schedule update: Deadline moved to [new date]. Analyze current iteration, identify minimum viable deliverables, rebalance priorities to fit timeline, update current-iteration.md with revised plan.
```

**Extended Timeline (More Time Available):**
```
Schedule update: Timeline extended to [new date]. Analyze current iteration, identify enhancement opportunities, add valuable features to scope, update current-iteration.md with expanded plan.
```

**Scope Change (Requirements Updated):**
```
Scope update: Requirements changed - [describe changes]. Analyze impact on current iteration, adjust priorities and timeline, update current-iteration.md with revised scope and schedule.
```
